## Layouts

Layouts are templates in the `_layouts` directory that contain the common
formatting for your pages.  They are compiled as [liquid
templates](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) (see
[reference](https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid)) using
[liquid-rust](https://github.com/cobalt-org/liquid-rust).

See [pages](/docs/pages.html) for more information on what
variables are available
