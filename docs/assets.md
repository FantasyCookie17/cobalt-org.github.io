## Assets

Assets are any non-[page](/docs/pages.html) files found in the
[`source`](/docs/config.html), like images, css, etc.

These will be mirrored directly in the [`destination`](/docs/config.html) directory.

### Sass

Cobalt has experimental support for Sass.  It requires [installing from
source](/docs/install.html).
